## üöÄ Features

*   **Dynamic Event List**: Displays a list of event lineup items, each with artist, time, and stage information.
*   **Custom Typography**: Utilizes a custom font (`Parkinsans`) to create a unique and branded visual identity for the app, as defined in `Type.kt`.
*   **Modern UI with Jetpack Compose**: The entire UI is built declaratively with Jetpack Compose, showcasing modern Android development practices.
*   **Efficient List Rendering**: Uses `LazyColumn` for efficient, high-performance display of the scrollable lineup.
*   **Clean, Structured Layout**: Employs `Column` and `Row` layouts to organize information clearly and intuitively for each lineup item.
*   **Themed Design**: Implements a custom Material 3 theme with a defined color palette and typography, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

*   **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**: The primary programming language for modern Android development.
*   **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)**: Android's modern UI toolkit for building native interfaces declaratively.
    *   **Material 3 (`1.3.0`)**: Leverages the latest Material Design components for a modern look (`Scaffold`, `Text`, etc.).
    *   **`LazyColumn`**: Efficiently displays the scrollable list of lineup items from the `androidx.compose.foundation` library.
    *   **Custom `FontFamily`**: Integrates the custom `Parkinsans` font from the `res/font` directory, configured in `Type.kt`.
    *   **Theming**: A custom theme is defined in the `ui.theme` package to centralize styling.
*   **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**: The official IDE for Android app development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure & How It Works

The application follows a standard Jetpack Compose structure.

1.  **`MainActivity.kt`**: This is the entry point of the app. It sets up the main `Scaffold` and calls the primary composable, `LineupScreen`.
2.  **`LineupScreen.kt`** *(Assumed)*: This file contains the core UI logic.
    *   It uses a `LazyColumn` to efficiently render the list of `LineupItem`s.
    *   Each item in the list is a custom composable that arranges the artist's name, time, and stage using `Row` and `Column` layouts.
3.  **`Data.kt`** *(Assumed)*: A file that likely contains the data model (`LineupItem` data class) and the sample data used to populate the list.
4.  **`ui/theme` package**:
    *   **`Type.kt`**: This is where the custom `ParkinsansFontFamily` is defined by loading the font from `R.font.parkinsans`. This `FontFamily` is then applied to the app's `Typography`.
    *   **`Color.kt`**: Defines the app's color palette.
    *   **`Theme.kt`**: Combines the colors and typography to create the `EventslineuplistTheme` that wraps the entire application UI.

## üé® Theming and Customization

A key feature of this project is its custom branding through theming. The `Parkinsans` font is loaded in `Type.kt` and integrated into the Material `Typography` object. This allows any `Text` composable using a style from `MaterialTheme.typography` (e.g., `style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleLarge`) to automatically render with the custom font, making theme management simple and powerful.

To change the font or add different weights, you can:
1.  Add new font files (e.g., `parkinsans_bold.ttf`) to the `res/font` directory.
2.  Update the `ParkinsansFontFamily` in `Type.kt` with the new `Font` resource.
